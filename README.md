Hi, I’m @flyboyCW12

I’m interested in Aircraft design and development (fixed wing drones).

I could describe myself as a self taught aeronautical engineer but that would be a bit over the top.
I am an open tx enthusiast, leveraging INAV installed in MatekSys flight controllers.  Mostly I don't crash! 

I've been building and flying models for 40 years.

I design using TurboCAD for 2D work and FreeCAD for 3D work mostly for printed parts which enhance the designs.

I’m currently learning Python/Micro-Python so that I can get back into Embedded Systems development and making decent progress with that.

I am a retired Electronics Engineer who can remember the Commodore PET (Wiki it!...the Science Museum in Munich still had one on display last time I was there).
