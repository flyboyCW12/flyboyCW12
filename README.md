- 👋 Hi, I’m @flyboyCW12
- 👀 I’m interested in Aircraft design and development (fixed wing drones).  I could describe myself as a self taught aeronautical engineer
- but that would be a bit over the top.  I am an open tx enthusiast, leveraging INAV installed in MatekSys flight controllers.  Mostly I don't crash! 
- I've been building and flying models for 40 years.  I design using TurboCAD for 2D work and FreeCAD for 3D work mostly for printed parts which enhance the designs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python/Micro-Python so that I can get back into Embedded Systems development.  I am a retired Electronics Engineer who can remember
- the Commodore PET (Wiki it...the Science Museum in Munich still have one on display).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Low Cost fixed-wing Drone Development for humanitarian purposes.
- 📫 How to reach me...Watch this space please.
